# SU-26M Performance

- Stock M14-P 360hp at sea level and 100% rpm.
- Airshow expected 3,000 ft density altitude west coast, 2,500 east coast. 4,000 DA just east of the rockies in the plains of Kansas.
- +12/-10 G limits observed.

## Low airspeed

- Approach 160 km/h (100 m/h) on final. Same speed for go around with 2-3 second spool-up to full throttle.
- 1 G power-off stall 115km/h (71 m/h)
- Minimum good control in all altitudes 130 km/h (80 m/h): good 3-axis control during advanced aerobatics.

## Aerobatic Reference speed

- 310 km/h (192 m/h). This speed is easily achieved and maintained between all vertical figures returning to level flight at 91% rpm.
- Dive in max speed 420 km/h (260 m/h). VNE is 450 km/h (280 m/h). Avoid asymetric rolling and pitching at this speed.
  - Used to make noise and get extra kinetic energy to start a vertical maneuver, such as at the beginning of a sequence.
 
## Maneuvering speed

- 360 km/h (223 m/h). Max deflection roll, or max deflection pitch, or max deflection yaw. Max input speed in one control dimension.

## Best Cornering Speed
